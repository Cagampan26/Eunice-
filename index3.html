Ayon sa pag-aaral, isa sa bawat tatlong batang Pilipino ang nakararanas ng malnutrisyon at stunting. Bilang Mayor ng ating Probinsyudad, mahalaga sa akin na matiyak na ang mga kabataang Taguigeño ay may sapat na nutrisyon  dahil ito ang susi sa pag-abot ng kanilang maximum potential. <font face="Ariel" color="black">

As part of PayPal Impact Day, teamed up with Hands On Manila Service Community for a day of giving back—Junior Highschool Department got their hands literally busy at Villamor Airbase Elementary School. <font face="Ariel" color="blue">
             <td>Bullying has no place in our schools, in our hearts, and in our community.
As the new school year starts, we stand together with one voice, one mission, and one goal — to create a safe and caring environment for every student. Through the Anti-Bullying and Child Protection Policy Campaign, we are reminded that no act of kindness is ever too small and no voice is ever too quiet when it speaks against injustice.</td>
             <td>An incredible heart and genuine compassion!
Showing your commitment to make an impact in our community makes a lot of difference in the lives of our learners and future leaders!
We are looking forward to more moments of service and community building with you. </td></tr>
